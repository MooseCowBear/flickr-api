This is an implementation of the [Flickr API Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flickr-api) from [the Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com) Rails path. 

## Features

Uses the Flickr API to retrieve photos by user id. 

## Screenshots

The home page before a search:

![alt text](/screenshots/home.png "home page")

With search results returned:

![alt text](/screenshots/search_results.png "photo results")

Displaying an error message. In this case, because the user id field was left empty.
